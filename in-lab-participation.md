## GitHub Classroom Instructions

### What is GitHub Classroom?
GitHub Classroom is a tool that automatically creates individual repositories for each student when they accept an assignment. This eliminates the need for manual forking and simplifies the submission process.

### Initial Setup (One-time)
1. **Accept the assignment** by clicking the GitHub Classroom link provided by your instructor
2. **Authorize GitHub Classroom** to access your GitHub account
3. **Your individual repository** will be automatically created and ready for use

### Before Each Lab Session
1. **Clone your assignment repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Web-Engineering-KFUPM/[ASSIGNMENT-NAME]-[YOUR-USERNAME].git
   cd [ASSIGNMENT-NAME]-[YOUR-USERNAME]
   ```
2. **Pull any updates** from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

## How to Submit Your Work

### During Lab Sessions
1. **Complete the assigned tasks** in your local repository
2. **Add and commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete lab exercise: [brief description]"
   ```
3. **Push your changes** to your assignment repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Submission Requirements
- **Timing**: Must be pushed during class time
- **Content**: Include all required files and changes
- **Quality**: Code should be functional and well-formatted
- **Documentation**: Add comments where appropriate
- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive, professional language

### Optional: GitHub Setup Assignment
Students who are new to Git and GitHub can complete an optional setup assignment to familiarize themselves with:
- Basic Git commands (add, commit, push, pull)
- GitHub repository navigation
- Creating and managing branches
- Resolving merge conflicts

This assignment is **not graded** but highly recommended for students with limited Git experience.

## GitHub Classroom Troubleshooting (Quick Guide)

1) Verify correct GitHub account
- Use the GitHub account registered with your KFUPM email (the one linked in Classroom).
- If unsure, ask your instructor which email is registered.

2) Clear browser authentication
- Sign out of all GitHub accounts in your browser.
- Clear cache, cookies, and saved logins.
- Log in again with your KFUPM-registered account.
- If still blocked, try Incognito/Private Mode or a different browser.

3) Access the lab link
- Open the provided GitHub Classroom link.
- If successful, create a fork of the repository and copy the fork URL.

4) Clone your fork
```bash
git clone <fork_link>
```

5) Make changes and prepare commit
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

6) Fix push/commit issues
- If `git push` fails, set your Git identity (must match a registered GitHub email):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Name"
git config --global user.email "your_kfupm_email@example.com"
```

7) Push changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

8) If problems persist
- Confirm youâ€™re using the GitHub account tied to Classroom.
- Re-authenticate GitHub on your computer (log out/in, reset credentials).
- Ask the instructor/TA to confirm your account mapping in GitHub Classroom.
