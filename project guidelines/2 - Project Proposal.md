# Milestone 2Ô∏è‚É£ Project Proposal

## üéØ Objective:
Develop and present a well-defined project proposal that outlines your team's web application idea. The proposal must articulate the problem your application aims to solve, identify its target users, and provide an overview of the system's intended functionalities and use cases.

## ü•ã Instructions:

### 1. Define/Review the Project Idea:
- Based on the previous milestone submission, finalize your team idea that addresses a real-world problem and provides meaningful value to its users.
- The idea must be:
  - Showing the creativity and innovation (no need to be 100% new things that have never existed before).
  - Realistic: Ensure it can be developed within the semester's timeline using the tools and technologies taught in this course.
  - Unique: You need to differentiate your idea than other ideas. 

### 2. Prepare a PowerPoint file:
Your submission must include the following slides:

#### Slide 1 & 2: Project Title and Team Members
- Provide a title for your project.
- List all team members.

#### Slide 3: Executive Summary
- Write a 1-paragraph (150-200 words) description summarizing the project.
  - Explain what your team is planning to do (the purpose and functionality of the application).
  - Avoid implementation details (the "how" you going to build it).

#### Slide 4-end: High-Level Description
- Users of the application:
  - Identify the types of users who will interact with your application (e.g., admin, regular users, or specific user groups like customers or service providers).
  - At least three distinct types of users (three roles) who will interact with your application.
- Functionalities for Each User Type:
  - Provide a list of key functionalities each user type can perform (e.g., "Admins can delete user accounts", "Admins can edit the user accounts information", "Users can browse and purchase items", etc.).
  - For each role needs to have `2 x number of people in your team` functionally. For example, if your team consist of 5 people then each role needs to have at leat 5 functionalities. If they are 6 then you must have 6 functionalities for each role.
  - Note: you can review the well-known concept in software engineering, which is **use case**.
- Storyboard Sketch ([See example](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/)):
  - Imagine a real use case where your solution will solve a real world problem.
  - Think of the different steps the user will take in your system to achive their goal

### 3. Submission Guidelines:
- Upload your PowerPoint file as PDF via Blackboard under the designated submission area.
- Your file containing:
  - Project Title and Team Members.
  - Executive Summary.
  - High-Level Description (Users, Functionalities, and Storyboard Sketch).
- Ensure your submission is professional, clear, and concise.
- Late submissions are not allowed unless there is a valid execuse.

## üí° FAQs

- **What is an acceptable scope for the project, in terms of ideas?**
Something useful that covers the basic web concepts and requires ~100 hours to complete (collectively by all members)

## üìä Grading Rubric:
The submission will be graded out of 100 points, divided as follows:

| **Criteria (Points)** | **Excellent (90-100%)** | **Very Good (80-89%)** | **Good (70-79%)** | **Acceptable (60-69%)** | **Poor (0-59%)** |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Project Idea and Feasibility (10)** | The idea is highly relevant to a real-world problem, innovative, and fully feasible within the timeline. | The idea is relevant and feasible, but slightly less innovative or ambitious. | The idea solves a real-world problem but lacks some feasibility or innovation. | The idea is only somewhat relevant or faces significant feasibility concerns. | The idea is irrelevant, unrealistic, or entirely infeasible.                  |
| **Executive Summary (10)** | Clear, concise, and comprehensive, fully describing the project‚Äôs purpose and objectives. | Well-written, but slightly less concise or missing minor details. | Adequate, but lacks some clarity or contains minor inaccuracies. | Basic summary provided, but missing key details or is poorly written. | Missing, unclear, or entirely off-topic summary. |
| **User Types (10)** | Clearly identifies all user categories and provides detailed, appropriate descriptions. | Identifies all user categories but with less detailed or slightly vague descriptions. | User categories identified, but descriptions lack depth or appropriateness. | Identifies only some user categories or provides minimal descriptions. | User categories are missing, unclear, or irrelevant. |
| **Functionalities (30)** | Functionalities are highly appropriate and well-matched to each user type. | Functionalities are appropriate but lack some refinement or depth. | Functionalities are somewhat appropriate, with noticeable gaps or redundancies. | Functionalities are only loosely connected to user needs or poorly defined. | Functionalities are irrelevant, incomplete, or missing entirely. |
| **Storyboard Sketch (15)** | Highly detailed, realistic, and relevant storyboard showcasing a practical use case. | Clear and relevant, but slightly less detailed or realistic. | Adequate storyboard but lacks depth or connection to a real-world scenario. | Minimal storyboard provided, with unclear or irrelevant context. | No storyboard, or it is entirely unrelated to the project. |
| **Uniqueness of Idea (15)** | The idea is highly original, presents a novel approach, and offers a clear competitive advantage. | The idea is somewhat unique, with minor similarities to existing solutions but notable improvements. | The idea has some originality but is largely similar to existing solutions with limited differentiation. | The idea shows minimal originality, relying heavily on existing concepts without meaningful innovation. | The idea is entirely unoriginal, lacks differentiation, or is a direct replication of existing solutions. |
| **File Formatting (5)** | Slides are exceptionally professional, well-organized, and adhere fully to guidelines. | Slides are professional and well-organized, with minor formatting issues. | Slides are adequately organized but lack visual appeal or have minor formatting errors. | Slides are poorly organized or fail to follow several formatting guidelines. | Slides are disorganized, unprofessional, or completely ignore submission guidelines. |
| **Peer Review Submission (5)**| Peer review is submitted on time, with constructive and detailed feedback provided for other groups. | Peer review is submitted on time, with helpful but slightly less detailed feedback. | Peer review is submitted but lacks depth or significant constructive feedback. | Peer review is minimally completed, with little useful feedback provided. | Peer review is missing, incomplete, or submitted late without justification. |
